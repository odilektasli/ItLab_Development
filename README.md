# IT Lab

### It Lab is the digital dircuit simulator for electricity laboratory courses in the universities. The project is developed by Özer DİLEKTAŞLI as the Becholor's Degree Computer Engineering graduation project using Unreal Engine 4 in 2021-2022 Fall semester.

The project can run on **_android devices_** as well as windows 10.

A short description video below about the abilities of the simulator.

### Implementation Technique

To represent the circuit in unreal engine, directed graph algorithm is used.
The image below describes how 2 bit adder circuit is represented as the graph.
The algorithm implemented using C++

Thanks to this approach an infrastructure has been provided to use on Blueprint.

The image below shows the decoder circuit that is constructed with graph infrastructure.

Thanks to this system all components are constructed according to their real life data sheet and work flows.
